            Currently people call me Niklas and i'm based on Earth, looking to migrate soon. <br>
            What fundamentally makes me happy: Learning & Exploring. <br>
            My domains:
        </p>
            <ul class = "ul1">
                <li>Finance</li>
                <li>Computers</li>

            Generally, they are based around dealing with numbers and logic. I am also interested in anything related to Health and Sports,
            but for the sole sake of making myself work at full capacity. Without the two of them, I would sacrifice my other automatically.
            In a parallel world, where self-improvement would not be based on sport and health, I would just as much care about self-
            improvement and not at all about sport and health. (For this text, I refer to health as mostly sleep, nutrition, other habits)

            Finance means to me knowing how to deal with ressources.
            Cost-cutting, identifying value, mapping financial forecasts are some key areas for me.
            Even in a parallel universe dealing with ressources does matter, because by nature everything has limits & constraints.
            <br><br>
            Computers means to me understanding and improving the state of technology.
            Artifical Intelligence, Robotics are some key areas for me.
            Even another type of civilization will have some sort of programming languages to pass instructions to machines.
            Having a good understanding of our machines on Earth will help me understand other machines.
            <br><br>
            Physics is about understanding the laws of nature.
            Astronomy, Astrophysics, Quantum Physics are some key areas for me.
            Wherever I am, those rules apply and they are key for my mission to migrate.
